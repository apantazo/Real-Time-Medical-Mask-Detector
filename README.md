# Real-Time-Medical-Mask-Detector
Mask Detection using Deep Learning, Computer Vision

## face_imagenet.py
We build the neural net using VGG-16 and train our model on a dataset which contains pictures of pictures wearing/not wearing medical mask.

## output.py
Using OpenCV we can detect with our model predictions if a person is wearing or not a medical mask through the webcam.
